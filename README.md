# Bonezegei_Utility
This Library contains several useful header files for bonezegei.

This paper presents Bonezegei Utility, an Arduino library that provides essential classes for using the Bonezegei Graphics Library. The Bonezegei Graphics Library is a lightweight and fast library for creating graphical user interfaces on Microcontroller devices. The Bonezegei Utility library contains Point, Rectangle, Display, Input, Bitmap and Font classes that are compatible with the Graphics Library and can be used to manipulate graphical elements, handle user input, load and display bitmap images and fonts, and manage the display buffer.

class:
  * Point class
  * Rect class
  * Bitmap class
  * Bonezegei_Display class
  * Bonezegei_Input class

Arrays:
  * Fonts (multiple array)
  * bitmap for bonezegei
